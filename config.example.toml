# Duckycap Varlink Configuration
#
# Configuration file for mapping key combinations to commands.
# The service will execute commands as the specified user when matching
# key combinations are received from the duckyPad device.

# User to run commands as (required)
user = "jayson"

# Command mappings
# Each mapping has:
#   - keys: Key combination string using + to combine keys (e.g., "meta+f1", "a", "ctrl+shift+b")
#   - cmd: Command to execute
#     - If cmd starts with '/', it's treated as an absolute path to a script
#     - Otherwise, it's run as a shell command

# Shell command example
[[commands]]
keys = "a"
cmd = "obs-cmd recording start"

# Script path example (absolute path)
[[commands]]
keys = "b"
cmd = "/home/jayson/scripts/volume-down.sh"

# More examples
[[commands]]
keys = "meta+f1"
cmd = "/home/jayson/scripts/toggle-mute.sh"

[[commands]]
keys = "ctrl+shift+k"
cmd = "loginctl lock-session"
